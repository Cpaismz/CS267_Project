DLW, March 2018

Cryptic notes about changes. There are so many changes, it is
hard to organize these notes:

- Testing: for the last three months, all testing has been on single fires in
single years.

- Thresholds: there are now only two thresholds for surface spread and they have
strong defaults: Forward ROS 0.1 m/min and HFI 10 Kw/m both can be
modified since they are command line arguments.

- Main loops: I tried to keep the main loops intact.

- Weather: A weather file is required. If you really want random weather,
 you still have to provide a file as a starting point. Random
 weather needs a lot of work. There is an option to control weather as
 random, date-based, or constant. Weather is no longer used
 directly for anything other than spotting; it is fed to FBP for ROS.

- Fire spread: the fire spread model is now based on FBP calculations.

- Time: the basic unit of time is minutes. We also track years, but that
needs work. Fire periods are given in minutes; weather periods (which
might not be the same as the fire period) are also given in minutes. There is limited
use of date-time in weather. The fire period lenghth needs to be <= weather period
length; both will be given in minutes.  Multiple years is not currently being
tested; most support is still there, though.

The notion of random start times and sel_week has not been deleted, but also has
not been maintained. I.e., random start *dates*, that probably needs
some work.

I am changing global_period to be week_number and I will try to leave it in
for reporting. Someday, one might want to use it with datetimes for weather (BTW:
when I write datetimes I am referrring the python package). It is now decoupled
from the Fire_Period, except that we use the Fire_Period to notice
that the week should be incremented.

- Forest.asc: we are getting the cell size from this file. Cells are square
and the cell size in this file is the length of a side.
