\section{Introduction}

{\bf dlw: this entire section assumes we are talking about
  support for harvest planning rather than a more focused discussion of fire spread.}

In order to evaluate methods for creating forest harvest plans for flammable forest landscapes, fire spread must
be simulated.
We will begin with some assumptions:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Timber harvest plans are issued and then executed each year. \label{list:planfreq}
	\item Harvesting takes place before fires.
	\item Regeneration takes place soon after harvesting. \label{list:replant}
	\item Harvest planning is carried out
          at the level of forest stands or {\em harvest blocks} and fire spread is modeled using much smaller {\em fuel cells}.
\end{enumerate}

Any of these assumptions could be relaxed later.

Assumption~\ref{list:planfreq} implies that the basic time
step for computing values and costs is one year. \\
Assumption~\ref{list:replant} is relevant for simulations that run for a large number of years.\\
Assumption~\ref{list:stepsize} is strong, fire can be modeled within minutes, good as a first approach.


\textbf{Simulator scheme}\\

In order to represent the problem's dynamics, figure \ref{tline} shows
the different events that can take place in a forest. At the beginning of every year we
have a \textit{HPeriod }(Harvest Period) when we make harvest
decisions - before fire dynamics - and every stand/block is regenerated
soon after these actions. After this \textit{HPeriod},
\textit{FPeriods }(Fire Periods), during which all fire ignitions and
fire spread events happen. 

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.9]{TimeLine.png}
\caption{\label{tline} Scheme of fire simulator.}	 
\end{figure}

Fire will start at some point - remembering that there is a specific
fire season (e.g., early spring to late fall) during which the fire spread model will start
to simulate the fire dynamics using the weather, fuel characteristics, and other information
provided to the simulator. In
figure \ref{Periods}, for example, we see a forest with 9
stands/blocks where a fire ignites in the first \textit{FPeriod }-
after the first \textit{HPeriod }- in cell 4 and then it spreads to
different harvest units for two more \textit{FPeriods }(note that the
harvest decision was to not cut any stands in the forest, since all the forest's
cells are available). After these periods, a new \textit{HPeriod} (next year) starts.

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{Periods.png}
	\caption{\label{Periods} Simulation example}
\end{figure}
Where:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $H_{t_{h}} = $ Harvest plan for $HPeriod$ $t_{h}$
	\item $R_{t_{h}} = $ Regeneration plan during $HPeriod $ $t_{h}$
	\item $FI_{i,t_{f}} = 1 $ if a fire ignites in cell/block $i$ during $ FPeriod $ $t_{f}$
	\item $FS_{j,i,t_{f}} = 1 $ if a fire spreads from cell/block $j$ to cell/block $i$ during $ FPeriod $ $t_{f}$
\end{itemize}

Then, we can define two main time sets: Harvest Periods
(\textit{HPeriods}) indicating the beginning of each year (independent
of the time step size) and Fire Dynamic periods (\textit{FPeriods})
during which fire ignitions and spread occur.

\newpage
We can define them in a general way:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Set \textit{Periods }:= $\lbrace \textit{t} \in \mathbb{Z^{+}} \rbrace $
	\item Set \textit{HPeriods }:= $ \lbrace t_{h} \in Periods: t_{h} = 1 + \alpha(1+h)$  where $\alpha \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}_{0}, h$ is the fire period size$\rbrace$
	\item Set \textit{FPeriods }:= $\lbrace t_{f} \in \bigcup_{t_{h}=1} [t_{h}+1,t_{h}+h] \rbrace $
\end{itemize}

xxxx tbd, DLW: describe the week scheme w.r.t. weather and also describe how the fire period
within the week is selected.

\section{SimName: Stochastic Cell-based simulator}

SimName is a stochastic wildland fire ignition \& spread cell-based simulator
developed in Python. It allows the user to simulate fire dynamics
inside a grid that represents a real forest based on
variables such as weather, fuel type in each cell, elevation (terrain
components), etc.

Its flexibility is one of the biggest advantages to other simulations
since it includes a series of user-defined options and almost all
parameters and variables can be modified in order to perform tests and
experiments, both real forest landscapes (real data instances) or user-generated
landscapes (instances.)

In addition, performance has been optimized in order to make it
possible to run large-scale simulations and it also
includes a parallel implementation based on the
Message Passing Interface (MPI).

\subsection{Fire Simulation}
	All Python code can be executed from a command line or from a GUI (work in progress).
	
	The simulation code is divided in 5 main steps:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Step 0: Initializing instances, classes, global parameters, sets, etc.} \\
	Instance data is read from external sources (or can be nested in the code, but not the best option), initializing global parameters and generating all the objects needed for the simulation. With parallel implementation, objects are created in parallel using the resources available. 	
		\item \textbf{Step 1: Lightning/Ignition loop to find the first week when fire occurs} \\
	Based on the scheme shown in section 2.4, simulation starts when a week is selected as a fire ``week". Once this week is selected, a cell,  based on its characteristics, status and probabilities, ignites and the fire spread model starts. \\
		\item \textbf{Step 2: Newly ignited cells possibly send spotting messages} \\
                  xxx TBD: presently once per ignition of each cell and based on wind speed, but maybe that should change and it should be based
                  on intensity...
      \item \textbf{Step 3: Burning cells possibly send messages to their  adjacent cells} \\
	Based on the weather, their status, characteristics and a probability distribution, burning cells can send messages to their adjacent cells. If no messages are sent, by any cell, and no cells are still burning, goto step 5.
		\item \textbf{Step 4: Messages processing}	\\
	Based on their status and characteristics, cells that recieve messages can ignite or not. Forest's cells status is updated. Goto Step 2. \\
		xxx this step is critical in parallel processing xxxx
		\item \textbf{Step 5: Results} \\
	Statistics, animations and plots are generated and recorded in separated files. A connection with a GIS allows a visual representation of the fire dynamic for real instances. \\
	
	In the case of plots and animations (gif files representing the fire's dynamics), colors represent the status of the cell: green for cells that are available to burn, brown for harvested cells, orange for burned cells and different reds for burning cells. Time decay factor is represented by this colors according to the fire's intensity, thus, when a cell has just been burned, it has the most intense red (alongside with the highest probability of spreading fire to its adjacent cells in the wind's direction) and every period its color will tend to an orange one. See
        Section~\ref{sec:gifs} for more details. 
	\end{itemize}

\end{figure}
 
In figure \ref{SImp} we can see an example of the fire dynamics
scheme. Fire ignites in cell 4 during the first \textit{FPeriod } -
first message sent to that cell - and this stand starts to send
``messages'' to some neighboring cells (or to all of them, depending
on weather conditions). Cell 4 sends a message to cells 1, 5 and
7. These messages are received by those cells and processed by an
independent core/thread in parallel by the simulator - using MPI - in
order to determine if they are going to ignite. In the next
\textit{FPeriod}, cells 1 and 7 burn because of the weather and
their own conditions while cell 5 does not burn. 

During the second FPeriod cells 1,4 and 7 are sending messages to cells 2,
5 and 8, \footnote{The following is no longer true: ``as a first approach, then we can add the possibility that
more than one cell sends a message to the same neighbor, augmenting
the probability of getting burnt for that cell'' instead, when a cell
receives a message it uses FBP to determine if it burns, and it does not
matter how many messages it gets} then parallel
processing starts again.\

FPeriods end when no more messages are being sent and no cells that could
send a message are still burning.
The forest's status is updated and a new HPeriod starts.

\subsection{Fire Spread Model}

The model is intended to approximately match real fire spread across a
gridded landscape at a macroscopic level (i.e., at the level of
multiple fuel cells). But is a not intended to be a re-enactment or
micro-simulation of the fire within a fuel cell. After discussing
ignition, we divide the discussion into two parts: spread to adjacent
cells, and spotting.

The Canadian Fire Behaviour Prediction (FBP)
system is a key component of the fire spread model. The FBP takes as
input information about the fuel type and terrain in each cell, wind
speed, wind direction, and fire danger rating indices (which are based
on daily or hourly observations of the weather). The FBP is used to
compute rate of spread (ROS) for a burning cell in four orthagonal
directions whose orientation is dermined by the main, or fire {\em
  head}, direction of spread that it calculates.

Each day the temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and 24 hour
precipitation are collected from fire weather stations at solar noon.  Those daily
weather observations are combined with the previous day's FFMC, DMC
and DC to compute the current day's FFMC, DMC and DC.  The current
day's FFMC and wind speed are used to compute the current day's ISI.
The current day's DMC and DC are used to compute the current day's
BUI.  The current day's ISI and BUI are used to compute the current
day's FWI.  We then model fire spread using those constant codes
and indices over the day.Hourly codes and indices can also be estimated.

In addition to a harvest period and a fire period, the software also
makes use of a weather period, typically a day or an hour. The weather
is updated once for each weather period.

\subsection{Ignition}


When a cell receives a message, the FBP determines what its head ROS
and fire intensity (HFI) would be if it were burning. If those values are above user-defined
thresholds, {\sc ROS-Threshold} and {\sc ROS-Threshold}, that cell starts burning.

\subsubsection{Spread to Adjacent Cells}

 While
the cell burns, the ROS values computed by the FBP are used to
determine how far the fire will spread in each fire time period. The fire
is tracked along vectors from the center of the burning cell to the
centers of all eight adjacent cells, but ignoring those adjacent cells that
have been harvested or already burned (since those cells are
assumed to be unable to burn). The ROS on each vector is determined by
interpolating the values given by the FBP system. The eight
adjacent cells are referred to as {\em neighbors.}

The ROS values for a burning cell are
adjusted stochastically using a user-specified parameter, {\sc
  ros-cv}, that provides the coefficient of variation for a normal
distribution around the ROS computed by the FBP. More formally, if the
ROS computed by the FBP is $\mu$, and $c=$ {\sc ros-cv}, then the standard deviation $\sigma$
is computed as
$$
\sigma = c\mu.
$$
The ROS used is then
distributed as $\mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma)$. The four orthagonal ROS
are treated as perfectly correlated. Note that
a value of zero for the {\sc ros-cv} results in using the ROS
value exactly as computed by the FBP.

The simulator triggers a message to a neighboring cell when
the fire spread calculations indicate that fire would
reach the center of that cell.
If either the cell's HFI or (randomly drawn) head ROS fall below the thresholds or
if there are no adjacent cells that could burn, the cell is considered
to be burned and ignored for further processing. \footnote{We have
  dropped so-called randomized burnout for now.}

Built into the fire spread model are numerous assumptions or
approximations that work pretty well, among them:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \label{listel:allburn} Since fuel cells are presumed to be relatively small, it is assumed
  that if they start burning, they can be labeled as burned, whether they
  send message to other cells or not.
\item \label{listel:ctr} Fire might spread into a cell during a paricular fire time period, but not to the center; in this
  case the cell will not be labeled as burning. Once the fire is computed (using the source cell's ROS) to be at the center of a neighbor, a message is sent to the neighboring cell, which triggers computations to determine if it will start burning based on the message.
\item One implication of eschewing detailed simulation of fire spread within a fuel cell is that we use
  an approximation to the fire's progress where the ROS for the fire
  along the vector between cells is always computed using ROS values
  of the source cell. It would be possible to micro-simulate
  by determining the time cell boundary crossing takes place and then using the
  fuel and terrain of the destination cell (the weather is the same for both cells) for ROS calculations. 
\item We assume that the user is knowledgeable enough to provide
  parameters that make sense collectively. I.e., the fuel cell sizes, fire period length should make sense when considered together {\bf so far: DLW says the fire period should be on the order of 0.1 sec per meter of cellsize.
    E.g., if the fuel cells are 100m on each side, then the fire period should perhaps be 10 to 15 seconds
  long.}
  
  

\end{enumerate}

Items~\ref{listel:allburn} and~\ref{listel:ctr} tend to balance
each other and the number of cells affected by either approximation
is fairly small.

\subsubsection{Spotting Model \label{sec:spotmodel}}

For each fuel cell that burns, a spotting calculation is done once.
Unlike surface spread, where we have the FBP and related models, for spotting
our software provides a capability but we expect to refine the software as additional
evidence-based spotting models become available.


\subsubsection{Version 1.0}

We take these input parameters:

\begin{itemize}
\item SPOTANGLE: The angle over which spotting occurs, centered on the wind direction.
\item SPOT0PROB: The probability of ``spotting'' at distance zero. I.e., the probability that any brands will become airborne.
\item SPOT10TIME: The time at which there is still a ten percent chance of
  spotting. For example, a value of 8 minutes indicates that fire brands
  aloft longer than this amount of time have less than a 0.1 probability
  of landing and potentially igniting a fire (i.e., less than 0.1 probability
  of ``sending a message''
  to the cell where they land, in the parlance of our simulator.)
\end{itemize}

For ease of locution, temporarily let $\beta \equiv$~SPOT0PROB and let
$\tilde{d} \equiv (w)$~(SPOT10TIME), which lets us define
$$
\alpha \equiv \frac{ln(.1)}{\tilde{d}} + \frac{ln(beta)}{\tilde{d}} 
$$

For any burning cell, the probability of spotting to a cell
outside the cone centered at the wind direction with
width SPOTANGLE degrees is zero. For other cells it is given
by
$$
\beta e^{\alpha d}
$$
where $d$ is the distance from the center of the burning cell
to the center of the other cell.

Note: derive alpha by setting the probability expression equal to 0.1
at distance $\tilde{d}$.

\subsubsection{Informal Discussion}

Based on common sense, one would expect that in more sophisticated
models, the humidity and temperature should impact the spotting
parameters. Also the probability should probably depend on the
deviation from the angle of the wind as well as the distance.

Maybe very soon, we should be using the crown spread rate to
impact the spotting parameters.

\subsection{Current features}
Besides the basic simulation steps described above, the current features included in SimName are:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Logical Grid output: statistical tests}\\
		Text files containing a grid structure can be obtained as outputs from SimName, representing the evolution and final fire scar in a simple format that allows the usage of statistical tools in order to perform comparisons between some experiments on real fires and/or other simulation software. 
	
	\item \textbf{3D-visualization}\\
		A three dimensional visualization of the current instance (currently limited only to real life instances) can be obtained as an executable application by the end of the simulation process. Integrating SimName with a GIS allows the user to visualize a 3D terrain representing the instance under study. 
		
	\item \textbf{Data files output: ready for optimizing}\\
		Data files representing each replication can be obtained by the end of the simulation process. These files can be read by optimization software such as PYOMO and AMPL, giving the user the opportunity to develop a stochastic optimization models without post-processing issues. 
		
	\item \textbf{Graphical outputs}\\
		Evolution grid plots can be obtained at any point of the simulation, being able to depict the full evolution of the fire since the ignition point until burnt-out. Simple .png file are then combined in order to generate an animated .gif file for visualization purposes.

	\item \textbf{Parallel Implementation (MPI)}\\
	  A natural distributive/parallel simulation approach is included in SimName. In order to take advantage of this implementation, tasks such as sending/receiving messages are naturally parallelized and distributed along the available resources (cores, nodes, etc.). Windows OS users may need special packages in order to be able to use this feature, for more details visit:

\section{Using the Software}

\subsection{quickstart}

For Unix users, the file quickstart.bash in FireSimulator provides a quick test
that the software is mostly installed and might provide a starting point
for some further work (the file quickstart.bat is intended to do the same
thing for Windows users).

\begin{verbatim}
BASEDIR="/home/david/Documents/Research/FireSimulator"
DDIR="$BASEDIR/Instances/9CellsHom/"
TORUN="$BASEDIR/Jan2018dlw/AlphaVersion/SimJan2018.py"

python $TORUN --input-instance-folder=$DDIR 
--ignitions --nsims=1 --output-grid 
--plot --combine --ROS-Threshold=0.1 
--output-folder=outdir --weather=rows
\end{verbatim}

There is one major command line that begins with ``python'' and appears to be on four
lines in this document. The first three lines just give values to bash variables
that are used in the command. Here is the meaning of the options
that used in this example:
\begin{itemize}
\item --input-instance-folder specifies the directory with the main input files.
  \item --ignitions indicates that the file named IgnitionPoints.csv in the directory with the main input files will give the ignition points.
  \item --nsims=1 means there will be one replicate. 
  \item --output-grid causes the first grid to be output
\item --plot indicates that plots should be output
    \item --combine indicates that fire evolution diagrams and the forest background should be comined
    \item --ROS-Threshold=0.1 means that if the head ROS as computed by the FBP would be above 0.1 the fire starts in a cell and can continue burning.
      \item --output-folder gives the name of the output directory
  \item --weather=row means that the file Weather.csv will give the weather row by row. 
\end{itemize}

One might want to add the option --verbose to get more detailed information as the
simulator executes.

\subsubsection{Getting Help}

To get an annotated list of possible commands, modify the bash or bat script
so that the only option is --help and then run it.

\section{Deterministic Tests}

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx re-do from here on xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
\end{document}
\subsection{9 Cells, constant wind, no slope}

The scripts 9CellsFlat.bash and 9CellsFlat.bat cause the simulator
to use input data that is 3x3 1k cells that are flat. It runs
with light constant wind. Large amounts of hard-to-read output are sent
to the screen. Plots are put in the Plots1 subdirectory of the
Plots subdirectory of the outdir subdirectory.

Here is the unix file followed by annotation.

\begin{verbatim}
BASEDIR="/home/woodruff/Documents/Research/FireSimulator"
DDIR="$BASEDIR/Instances/9CellsDLW"
TORUN="$BASEDIR/Jan2018dlw/AlphaVersion/SimJan2018.py"

python $TORUN --input-instance-folder=$DDIR --ignitions --nsims=1 
--output-grid  --weather-file --weather=constant  --sim-years=1 
--ROS-Start-Threshold=1e-3 --Mean-Burnout-Periods=0 
--output-folder=outdir --ROS-CV=0 --PeriodLen=60 --verbose 
--save-memory --plot --combine
\end{verbatim}

Annotated list of options used:

\begin{itemize}
\item --input-instance-folder gives the name of (or path to) the directory that contains the input files (with hard-wired names: Data.dat, Weather.csv, Forest.asc) Currently, the header data in Forest.asc is not used by the simulator,
  except cellsize, which determines the lengt of a side of fuel cells (assumed square).
  \item --ignitions indicates that the file named IgnitionPoints.csv in the directory with the main input files will give the ignition points.
  \item --nsims=1 means there will be one replicate. 
  \item --output-grid causes the first grid to be output
  \item --weather-file indicates that a weather file (Weather.csv) will be read from the main input folder
  \item --weather=constant indicates that the weather file will be ignored except for the first row, which will determine the wind for entire simulation (if --verbose is selected this will cause a reminders and warnings in the output, which are normal)
\item --sim-years=1 indicates that this will be single year (and therefore simgle file) simulation
    \item --ROS-Start-Threshold=1e-3 means that if the head ROS as computed by the FBP would be above 0.001 the fire starts in a cell. This is in the units of meters per minute. This is a very low value.
\item --Mean-Burnout-Periods=0 means there will be no burnout (cells will burn until there are not neighbors that could receive a message)
\item --output-folder=outdir indicates that the output folder will be a local subdirectory named outdir
\item --ROS-CV=0 means that the rate of spread will have a coefficient of variaion of zero; i.e., deterministic. If this is not zero, the ROS is normally distributed with the the given CV.
\item --PeriodLen=60 is used because the fire period is 60 minutes long and the FBP give ROS in meters/minute.
\item --verbose causes huge amounts of output to stdout.
\item --save-memory needed for large instances on small computers; causes a small increase in run time, but causes some summaries to be unavailable.
\item --plot indicates that plots should be output to a subdirectory of the output directory. Notes that if --nsim=x with x greater than one is used, there is one subdirectory per simulation run.
    \item --combine indicates that fire evolution diagrams and the forest background should be comined
\end{itemize}


\subsection{400 Cell}

Data and scripts for a 400 cell example are in a subdirectory of the Instances
subdirectory called 400CellsDLW and its subdirectories. The present version of
the scenarios has some aspects of fire periods hard-wired to be hours, so
these tests are done use data appropriate for fire periods that are hours.
In particular, the fuel cells are assumed to be 1k meters by 1k meters. While
the 9 cell forest is c2 fuel, the 400 cell forest is c1.

\subsubsection{FBPTester.bash Script}

This script causes the simulator to do one call to FBP and display the inputs and
outputs.

\subsubsection{doit.bash Script}

Here is the unix version of the doit.bash script followed by
annotation to explain each option.

\begin{verbatim}
BASEDIR="/home/woodruff/Documents/Research/FireSimulator"
DDIR="$BASEDIR/Instances/400CellsDLW/test1inputs"
TORUN="$BASEDIR/Jan2018dlw/AlphaVersion/SimJan2018.py"

python $TORUN --input-instance-folder=$DDIR --ignitions --nsims=1 
--output-grid  --weather-file --weather=constant  --sim-years=1 
--ROS-Start-Threshold=1e-3 --Mean-Burnout-Periods=0 
--output-folder=outdir --ROS-CV=0 --PeriodLen=60 --verbose 
--save-memory --plot --combine
\end{verbatim}

Annotated list of options used:

\begin{itemize}
\item --input-instance-folder gives the name of (or path to) the directory that contains the input files (with hard-wired names: Data.dat, Weather.csv, Forest.asc) Currently, the header data in Forest.asc is not used by the simulator,
  except cellsize, which determines the area of fuel cells (assumed square).
  \item --ignitions indicates that the file named IgnitionPoints.csv in the directory with the main input files will give the ignition points.
  \item --nsims=1 means there will be one replicate. 
  \item --output-grid causes the first grid to be output
  \item --weather-file indicates that a weather file (Weather.csv) will be read from the main input folder
  \item --weather=constant indicates that the weather file will be ignored except for the first row, which will determine the wind for entire simulation (if --verbose is selected this will cause a reminders and warnings in the output, which are normal)
\item --sim-years=1 indicates that this will be single year (and therefore simgle file) simulation
    \item --ROS-Start-Threshold=1e-3 means that if the head ROS as computed by the FBP would be above 0.001 the fire starts in a cell. This is in the units of meters per minute. This is a very low value.
\item --Mean-Burnout-Periods=0 means there will be no burnout (cells will burn until there are not neighbors that could receive a message)
\item --output-folder=outdir indicates that the output folder will be a local subdirectory named outdir
\item --ROS-CV=0 means that the rate of spread will have a coefficient of variaion of zero; i.e., deterministic. If this is none zero, the ROS is normally distributed with the the given CV.
\item --PeriodLen=60 is used because the fire period is 60 minutes long and the FBP give ROS in meters/minute.
\item --verbose causes huge amounts of output to stdout.
\item --save-memory needed for large instances on small computers; causes a small increase in run time, but causes some summaries to be unavailable.
\item --plot indicates that plots should be output to a subdirectory of the output directory. Notes that if --nsim=x with x greater than one is used, there is one subdirectory per simulation run.
    \item --combine indicates that fire evolution diagrams and the forest background should be comined
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Plots and Movies}

After the script is executed, there are png files in the Plots1 subdirectory of the Plots subdirectory of the outdir subdirectory. One can make a movie based on these files. (Aside: it is a good idea to delete all of the Plotsx subdirs between runs so that files from the ``last run'' are not retained). Assuming
the relevant software is installed, on Unix use:

\verb|ffmpeg -i forest%04d.png firemovie.gif|

or

\verb|ffmpeg -i forest%04d.png -filter:v "setpts=5.0*PTS"  firemovie.gif|

to slow down the movie.

On Windows use software such as ImageMagick.

\section{Verification}

In order to verify that the software executes the simulation algorithm
as described, we conducted some experiments.

\subsection{9 Cells}

For full details, see \verb|Instances/9CellsDLW| and \verb|Instances/9CellsDLW/veifyrunsoutputs|

Since it is not a micro-simulator, SimName is not really designed for
simulations with only nine cells, but this small forest works well for
verifying that the software operates as expected. The cells are
numbered from left to right, top to bottom; so the SE cell is number 9
and the NW cell is number 1.

Some experiments have constant wind speed and direction, but for those
that have varying wind, the first ten hours are shown in
Figure~\ref{tab:first10}. The main thing to notice is the two
direction reversals and the very high speed starting in hour 4.

The forest is flat and all nine cells have the same non-wind inputs to
FPB that are shown in Table~\ref{tab:9cellfbp}.

  \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Relevant forest inputs for FBP of nine cell homogenous experiments. \label{tab:9cellfbp}}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{One hour periods for 1k by 1k cells}

For these
experiments, the fire time periods are each one hour long and the fuel cells aer
1km by 1km. Ignition is in cell 5, which is the cell in the center.
For full details, see \verb|Instances/9CellsDLW| and \verb|Instances/9CellsDLW/veifyrunsoutputs|; summaries of experiments are given
in Tables~\ref{tab:9celldet}, \ref{tab:randconstwind}, and ~\ref{tab:flipwind9}.

\end{table}

\subsubsection{One Minute Fire Period}

For these experiments, the fire period is one minute. Experiments are done
with cells that are 10m by 10m and also 20m by 20m, which are smaller and larger
respectively than the 1/60 time scaling when applied to cells that are 1km by 1km as used
in the previous section. In macroscopic terms, the result also bracket the earlier
results; i.e., the smaller cells have higher average burn rate and the larger
cells a lower rate given fixed values of the burnout parameter, which is given
in time units.

\subsection{400 Cells, homogenous forest}

The homogenous 400 cells in the forest have the same characteristics
as those in the 9 cell forest, except that while
the 9 cell forest is c2 fuel, the 400 cell forest is c1. For full details see, see
\verb|Instances/400CellsDLW|,
\verb|Instances/400CellsDLW/nowindnoslope|,
\verb|Instances/400CellsDLW/test1inputs|, and
\verb|Instances/400CellsDLW/veifyrunsoutputs|

\subsubsection{Ignition in Cell 210}

With no wind, no variation in ROS, and no burnout, the simulation
terminates after fire period (hour) 51 when the fire reaches the
center of the last cell, which is cell 20. In period 50, the fire
reaches the center of cells 1, 19, 40, and 400. This makes sense since
cell 210 is just to the south and east of the center.
In hour 5, the fire first reaches the center of cells 190, 209, 211, 230.

\section{Tutorial}

xxxxxxxxxx WARNING: from here on, some things might not be accurate. DLW Jan 28, 2017 xxxxxxxxxxx

The usage of the simulator is very straightforward for users with python background. Current implementation must be called (invoked) using the command line (Unix or Windows) and some packages are needed in order to exploit all the functionalities.
\subsubsection{Getting started}
The following Python packages are needed in order to run the simulator. Most of them are included in scientific python distributions like Anaconda (recommended) or they can be separately installed via pip --install PACKAGE\_NAME in the command line. 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item numpy
	\item mpi4py
	\item openpyxl
	\item ctypes
	\item matplotlib
	\item pandas
	\item pprint
\end{enumerate}
In a future implementation, the simulator will be distributed as a python package installing all the necessary third party packages (dependencies).

The simulator also uses a shared library object (.so) in order to call some functions used by the Canadian Fire Behavior Prediction (FBP) System. Thus, the following code should be executed before running the simulator:

\textbf{gcc -c -fpic} FBPfunc5\_NoDebug.c 

\textbf{gcc -shared -o} FBPfunc5NODEBUG.so FBPfunc5\_NoDebug.o\\

*\textbf{Note}: Windows users should install a compiler like \href{http://www.mingw.org/}{MinGW} in order to compile the .so object using the previous code lines.
\subsubsection{Basics}
After downloading and decompressing the .rar file, the basic elements/files of SimName are (see \ref{fig:SFiles}):
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Modules}: Each one associated with a class of the main program. They should be in the same folder as the main code.
	
	\item \textbf{FBP files}: FBP functions in both C and Python format. These files are needed in order to compile the shared library object.
	
	\item \textbf{Main}: SimV1, the main code of the simulator. 
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{SimFiles.png}
\caption{\label{fig:SFiles} Basic SimName files}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Simulator Files}
SimName needs a specific structure of input files in order to be able to perform the simulatios. Once a simulation is performed, different output files can be obtained depending on the arguments passed through the command line.
\begin{enumerate}
		
	\item \textbf{Main Inputs}\\
	  SimName requires three main input files in order to start the simulations. These files are placed by the user in a directory, whose path is given
          as an argument to the --input-instance-folder command line option.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Data.dat}: This csv file contains all the relevant information for each cell, including fueltype, elevation, coordinates, wind speed and direction on that cell, among other parameters.
	
\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{Tutorial4.png}
\caption{\label{fig:Tut4} Quick tutorial: Data (.dat) input file}
\end{figure}	
	
		\item \textbf{fbp\_lookup\_table.csv}: 	This csv file contains all the fuel types information and codification. It follows the same format used in Prometheus including the RGB associated to each type in order to plot the forest grid using characteristics colors depending on the cells' fuel type.
		
		
\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{Tutorial5.png}
\caption{\label{fig:Tut5} Quick tutorial: FBP lookup table  content (Prometheus csv format)}
\end{figure}
			
\item \textbf{Forest.asc}: Following Prometheus format, this file contains a grid representing the real forest' cells using the codification specified in the fbp\_lookup\_table.csv file. This file determines the
  cell size (It also includes information regarding the number of columns/rows of the forest and the coordinates associated to the left bottom corner of it.		
		
\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{Tutorial6.png}
\caption{\label{fig:Tut6} Quick tutorial: Forest grid input file (Prometheus asc format)}
\end{figure}
		
		
	\end{itemize}
		
	\item \textbf{Optional Inputs}\\
	Users can give three optional files as inputs before starting the simulation in order to modify some specific aspects of the replications:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{IgnitionPoints.csv}: Useful for simulating real fires or testing purposes, this file contains information related which cells will be selected as ignition points for each year of the planning horizon. Repeating the same cell every year will lead to a one period simulation. Note that is the selected cell is not burnable, SimName will detect this situation and a message will be printed in the command line.
		
		If not given by the user, ignition points are randomly selected every period.
		
\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{Tutorial7.png}
\caption{\label{fig:Tut7} Quick tutorial: Ignition points (csv) input file}
\end{figure}

\item \textbf{SpotParms.json}: This file name
  is not hard-wired, but given by concatentating the --input-instance-folder
  and the --spotting-parameter-data-file-name options. There are three
  parameters as shown in this example:
  \begin{verbatim}
{"SPOTANGLE": 30, "SPOT0PROB": 0.1, "SPOT10TIME": 3600}
\end{verbatim}
  See Section~\ref{sec:spotmodel} for more details.

		
		
		\item \textbf{Weather.csv}: Hourly weather records from relevant weather stations. If not included, the user can use some pre-defined options like random,constant or all-directions-wind weather.
		
\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{Tutorial9.png}
\caption{\label{fig:Tut9} Quick tutorial: Hourly weather csv input file (Prometheus format)}
\end{figure}
	\end{itemize}		

\newpage
Hence, a typical instance folder will look like this:	
	
\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{Tutorial1.png}
\caption{\label{fig:Tut1} Quick tutorial: Folder contents}
\end{figure}
	
	
	
	\item \textbf{Outputs}\\
	Depending on the arguments given to the simulator (\textbf{see next section}), different folder/files can be obtained after runing SimName:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{ForestGrids}\\
			When using the --output-grid argument a new folder (ForestGrids) will be generated in the current working directory. This folder contains a series of csv files that contains a grid with 1s (burnt) and 0s (not burnt) representing the final state of the forest associated with each independent replication. \\
			
\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{Tutorial10.png}
\caption{\label{fig:Tut10} Quick tutorial: Forest grids folder after simulation}
\end{figure} 

These files are useful for statistical comparison and visualization purposes without needing an intense usage of hardware resources (like with the plot option), making each replication very fast while recording useful information. \\

As seen in figure \ref{fig:Tut12}, the user can appreciate the final fire scar corresponding to each replication, including information regarding the number of rows and columns of the forest as well as its coordinates.\\

In addition, these files can be read by an extra module included with the simulator files in order to both plot the forest with the corresponding color palette and/or generate the three-dimensional map (see section 3)
			
\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{Tutorial12.png}
\caption{\label{fig:Tut12} Quick tutorial: Example of forest grid file where 1s represents burnt, 0s not burnt.}
\end{figure}


%\begin{figure}[h!]
%\centering
%\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Tutorial13.png}
%\caption{\label{fig:Tut13} Quick tutorial: Example of forest %grid file 50x50 homogeneous instance}
%\end{figure}			
			
		\item \textbf{Plots}\\
		When the argument --plot is given to the simulator, SimName will output a series of plots depicting the evolution of the fire since the ignition occurs. Including this option will generate a new folder called Plots containing all the plots for each independent replication. \\
		
		If it is the first time running an instance, a new file called ForestInitial.png (see \ref{fig:Tut2} and \ref{fig:Tut3}) will be created. This file will be used as a background image when plotting the active cells, allowing the simulator to be very efficient in the RAM usage levels. After the first running, this step is skipped if the file is still located in the working directory, otherwise, it will create it again. \\
		
		Using it alone will lead to a series of plots only showing the burnt/burning cells (saving memory usage) while using it with --combine option will give the user full plots including all cells and background (based on previously created ForestInitial file). \\
		
\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{Tutorial2.png}
\caption{\label{fig:Tut2} Quick tutorial: Initial forest plot}

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{Tutorial16.png}
\caption{\label{fig:Tut16} Quick tutorial: Evolution plots example when using --plot and --combine arguments}
\end{figure}

Thus, by the end of a replication the user will have a set of pictures (see figure \ref{fig:Tut16}) depicting the evolution of the fire scar while indicating which cells are spreading the fire (sending messages) to others. Note that each cell color is determined by the fbp\_lookup\_table.csv (rgb fields) file and the coordinates represent the number of rows and columns inside the forest. The area/resolution of each cell is $100^2 [m^2]$ by default, however, it can be modified by the user inside the Forest.asc file.  

\newpage
		
		
		\item \textbf{Scenarios}\\
			In order to connect the simulation outputs with optimization software (like AMPL, PYOMO and solvers), the argument --scenarios-out can be given to the command line when executing SimName. After each replication, a Scenario.dat file will be created with all the relevant information using the format defined in the \textbf{previous documentation} file. Thus, each .dat file includes all the information regarding the ignition points ($FI$ parameter), fire spread dynamic ($FS$ parameter) and sets definition ($HPeriods, FPeriods$). \\
		
Thanks to this output, each replication result is ready to be used as a scenario when developing and solving a multi-stage stochastic problems in packages like PYOMO, saving a lot of time for the user.

\caption{\label{fig:Tut17} Quick tutorial: ScenarioX.dat file format}
\end{figure}
		
		
	\end{itemize}
	
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{CMD line arguments}
In order to exploit all the features of SimName, the user should combine a series of arguments that can be given to the simulator as inputs via command line. The current arguments are the following: 

xxxxxx dlw Jan 2018: needs update xxxxxx

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{-h, --help}: shows a help message (summary of all possible arguments) and exit.

\item \textbf{--input-data-file} INPUT\_FILE\_NAME: Path and name of the csv file that contains the data (not needed if input instance folder is given). \hfill (String)

\subsubsection{Running SimName: Examples}
Depending on the version of Python installed, users must invoke the corresponding version of SimName. Currently, SimName can be used in both Python 2.7 and 3.x versions. \\

In order to run one experiment/instance the user should invoke python and then call the main program SimV1.py. After that, users can add as many arguments they want, taking into account the type of input needed. \\

Notice that the user can set the argument --no-output (boolean) in order to not get any output from the active console (just the number of the current replication). On the other hand, --verbose option will output all the information log of each replication.

Some examples:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Run 100 independent replications in the ``save memory'' mode with custom thresholds, using a folder with all the necessary input files (Thresholds.csv, Weather.csv, Data.csv, Forest.asc) without showing anything on the console and generating Forest grids (one per replication). 
	
\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{CMD1.png}
\caption{\label{fig:CMD1} Quick tutorial: Command line example (1)}
\end{figure}

	
	\item Run 100 independent replications with spotting, using a folder with all the necessary input files (Thresholds.csv, Weather.csv, Data.csv, Forest.asc) showing current replication number on the console and generating Forest grids (one per replication) and scenarios.  
	
\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{CMD2.png}
\caption{\label{fig:CMD2} Quick tutorial: Command line example (2)}
\end{figure}
	
		\item Run 50 independent replications with spotting, using a folder with all the necessary input files (Thresholds.csv, Weather.csv, Data.csv, Forest.asc) showing current replication number on the console and generating Forest grids (one per replication), plots (combining the fire scar with the forest's background) and scenarios. 
	
\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{CMD3.png}
\caption{\label{fig:CMD3} Quick tutorial: Command line example (3)}
\end{figure}
	
\end{itemize}

The power of using the command line invocation relies on the possibility of sending a set/batch of experiments with only one file. Therefore, batch file (Windows OS) and/or bash files (Unix) can be generated with the arguments needed by the user such that multiple experiments are performed.

\newpage

\subsubsection{Output Examples}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Dogrib instance with constant east ($0^°$) wind.}\\
	In this example, we run the Dogrib forest instance (as in Prometheus) with a constant east wind instead of the original north-east direction for simulating another possible fire spread dynamic on the same forest. \\
	
	As we can see in figure \ref{DPE} the ignition point is the same as the original fire but since the wind direction is different (and constant) in this case we end up with a different fire scar, that actually reaches the eastern border of the instance under study. \\

	Therefore, it is possible to understand the power of SimName when performing different experiments and tests when some parameters are modified (more details in \textbf{section 4}).

\caption{\label{DPE} Fire evolution for Dogrib instance when using constant east wind ($\theta=0$) in SimName.}
\end{figure}

\newpage 

	\item \textbf{15 Cells with barrier, random wind}\\
	This instance can be used for testing the spotting function of SimName since the fire will not spread across the vertical ``barrier'' in the second column of cells. In figure \ref{Barrier15} we can see how the fire spreads only on the right side of the barrier since no spotting argument was given.

\end{figure}

\newpage

	\item \textbf{400 Cells Homogeneous, west and constant wind}
	In this case, we have a homogeneous (one fuel type) instance consisting of 400 cells with west and constant wind. This means that west (plus north and south) spread directions are allowed at each period, for testing purposes.

\section{3D output: GIS based output (work in progress)}
In order to obtain a more realistic visualization of the results of the simulation, an integration of the simulator with a Geographical Information System (GIS) has been done. 

Using satellite pictures of the relevant areas under study, an algorithm obtains the texture and heightmaps of the zones in order to generate three-dimensional meshes based on the elevation of the different components of the terrain (everything is on a real scale). Then it adds the terrain textures (based on satellite images, like Google Earth), 3D-trees associated with the fuel type and it is possible to actually see the fire evolution in a 3D animation (not in these pictures).\\

\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.55]{Heightmap1.png}
\caption{\label{hm1} Heightmap to 3D-mesh process}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.30]{texturedmap.jpg}
\caption{\label{tm1} Textured 3D-terrain based on a heightmap}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Output}
Two main outputs are generated when using the GIS based script:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{3D-Visualization APP}\\
	After simulating a fire, a visual application is created in an external server (internet connection needed). This consists of a 3D application that allows the user to view and interact with the three-dimensional forest generated from the satellite pictures and height maps. \\

	Thanks to this application, the user would be able to ``visit'' the original forest and compare it with the final state reached after the fire period. \\

	In addition, the user can move and visit each part of the forest ``flying'' and/or ``walking'' over the 3D-terrain. The application also takes into account the current time - internet connection needed - and simulates the "real life" climate and light (day, night, raining, etc.)
			
	\item \textbf{Video}\\
	Based on the evolution of the fire scar and cells' information of each replication, a 3D-animated video is generated, showing the evolution of the fire from the initial  state of the forest until the end of the fire period.
	
\end{enumerate}



\subsection{Examples}
The basic plot obtained by the simulator when dealing with a complete instance is based on the information contained inside the Forest.asc file where the forest grid information is codified depending on the cells' fuel types. Same input (see \ref{fig:Dog2d}) is generated when working with Prometheus. 

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=1.0]{Dogrib2D.png}
\caption{\label{fig:Dog2d}Dogrib 2D forest example, as seen in Prometheus}
\end{figure}

These maps -as we already indicated in previous sections- will be used as the general backgrounds for generating the simulator graphics. In addition, thanks to this implementation we do not ask the simulator to recompute the plot for those cells who were not actually active during the replication (burning state) saving a relevant amount of memory usage.

However, these ``pixelated'' cells' based maps are not completely accurate to the real forest distribution since a series of approximations must be done in order to fit it into the grid disposition while satisfying cells' resolution limitations, and they also lack of details that can be relevant to further analyze some harvesting and/or firewall policies.

Thus, an integrated workflow with a GIS is performed by the end of the simulation. Based on a web-server's script, a 3D-textured mesh is generated (see \ref{fig:Dog1}) from the associated heightmap and satellital pictures obtained from different services like gooogle maps/earth.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{Dogrib3D_1.png}
\caption{\label{fig:Dog1}Dogrib 3D model example: Aerial view}
\end{figure}

A 3D-forest visualization app is generated using the data from the GIS. Then, the user can visit and visualize any point of the virtual terrain (real scale). Examples of this output can be seen in figures \ref{fig:Dog1} to \ref{fig:Dog7}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{Dogrib3D_2.png}
\caption{\label{fig:Dog2}Dogrib 3D model example: Mountains view}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{Dogrib3D_3.png}
\caption{\label{fig:Dog3}Dogrib 3D model example: Landscape view}
\end{figure}

As can be seen in the pictures, the visualization app takes into account the position, texture and volume of each component of the terrain in order to generate the 3D-mesh, texturizing it with data collected from satellital services. In addition, light/shadows and weather elements are calculated using online information, giving a ``real and live'' view of the forest state before and after the simulation. 

\newpage

\begin{figure}[h!]

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{Dogrib3D_7.png}
\caption{\label{fig:Dog7}Dogrib 3D model example: Night ambientation.}

Hence, a completely interactive visualization app is generated by the simulation when using the GIS-based output module.


\subsection{Modules: Classes (updating in progress...)}
In the current implementation, the following classes are used by SimName:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{CellsFBP} \\
Detailed information about each forest's cell, including the send/receive messages functions (fire spread model) and all the math involved when determining a new Fire. This is the most important class of the simulator.\\ $Obj$ = $Cells(ID,Area,Coord,Age,FType,Terrain,Vol,Perimeter,Status,Adjacents,Colors)$
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Parameters}\\
 		\textbf{Inmutables} 
 			\begin{itemize}
 				\item $ID$: Id number. \hfill (int) 
 				\item $Area$: Area of the forest [ha]. \hfill (float)
 				\item $Vol$: Volume in [$m^{3}$] of cell. \hfill (float) 
 				\item $Coord$: Coordinates of cell [lat,long,alt]. \hfill (list[float])
 				\item $Age$: Age of the forest. \hfill (int) 
 				\item $FType$: Types of fuel. \hfill (int) 
 				\item $Terrain$: Type of terrain. \hfill (int)

 				\item $Adjacents$: Adjacent cells divided/classified by cardinal points. \hfill (dictionary) \\
 				\item $Colors$: Cells RGB colors based on fuel types. \hfill (list) \\
 				
 				\textbf{Examples} 
 				 \begin{enumerate}
 					\item Vol = $1000$
 					\item TerrainD = $\lbrace 0: ``Soft", 1: ``Medium", 2: ``Hard"\rbrace$ 
 					\item $Adjacents = \lbrace``N": $[$\cdot$]$,``NE": $[$\cdot$]$,``NW": $[$\cdot$]$, ``S":$[$\cdot$]$ ,``SE":$[$\cdot$]$ ,``SW":$[$\cdot$]$ , ``E":$[$\cdot$]$, ``W":$[$\cdot$]$ \rbrace$, where [$\cdot$] are lists that include all the adjacent cells in the eight possible directions, related to the angle between cell's gravity centers (see figure 4). \\
 				 \end{enumerate}
 				
 				
 			\end{itemize}
 			
 			\textbf{Mutables}
 			\begin{itemize} 
 					
 				\item $Status$: Status of the cell. \hfill (int) 
				\item $FICell$: List with Fire ignition parameter. 1 if fire ignites in cell $i$ in period $t$. \hfill (list[int]) 				
 				\item $FSCell$: List with Fire spread parameter. Indicates the adjacent cell's ID if fire spreads from cell $j \in Adjacents_i$ to $i$ in period $t$.  \hfill (list[int])
 				\item $HPeriod$: indicates the period where the cell is harvested (if). \hfill (int)
 				\item $Firestarts$: indicates the period where the cell is burnt (if burnt). \hfill (int)
 				\item $GMsgList$: List with received messages for a cell. \hfill (list[lists]) \\ 
 				
\newpage	
 				 \textbf{Examples}
 				 \begin{enumerate}
 					\item Status parameter is associated to a dictionary defined by StatusD = $\lbrace 0: ``Available", 1: ``Burning", 2: ``Burnt", 3: ``Harvested"\rbrace$.  
 					\item $FICell = $[$0,0,1,0,0,0,...$], then, fire ignites in period 3 for this cell. 
 					\item $FSCell = $[[$\cdot$],[$\cdot$],[$\cdot$],[$2$],[$\cdot$],...], then, fire comes from cell 2 in period 4. 
 				\item $GMsgList = $[[$\cdot$],[3,6,7],[1],[$\cdot$],...] indicates that this cell got messages from cells $3, 6$ \& $7$ in period 2 and a message from cell $1$ in period 3. \\
 				 \end{enumerate}
 				 

 				
 			\end{itemize} 
 			
 		\item \textbf{Functions \& Methods}
 			\begin{itemize}
 				\item $set\_Status(Status_int)$:\\ Changes the status of the cell: 0 available, 1 burnt, 2 harvested. \hfill (void method)
 				\item $get\_Status()$:\\ Returns cell status. \hfill (returns string)
 				\item $send\_msg(Period,Weather,AvailSet)$:\\ A cell sends messages to its available (not burnt or harvested) adjacent cells based on weather. \hfill (returns list[int])
 				\item $ignition(Period,Lambda,Weather)$:\\ Determines if a cell ignites, based on the period, cell characteristics and Poisson distribution.\hfill (returns boolean)		
 				\item $got\_Burnt(Period,Weather,NMsg)$:\\ Based on the number of messages (with at least 1 msg), weather and cell characteristics, determines if the cell gets burnt. \hfill (returns boolean)
				\item $got\_burnt\_from(Period,MsgLists)$:\\ Computes FS parameter. \hfill (void method)
 				\item $print\_info()$:\\ Prints Cell information (ID, Status, Area, etc.). \hfill (void method)\\ 
 			\end{itemize} 
 			\textbf{Examples}			
\begin{itemize}

			
 			\item $send\_msg(Period,Weather,AvailSet)$ \\
 			A cell will send messages to its adjacent cells only if some conditions are satisfied: 
 			\begin{enumerate}
 				\item Wind Speed $\geq$ WST \hfill (wind speed lower bound)
 				\item Temperature $\geq$ TMT \hfill (Temperature lower bound)
 				\item Dew Point $\geq$ DPT \hfill (dew point lower bound) 
				\item Precipitation $\leq$ RNT \hfill (precipitation upper bound) 				
 				\item Radiation $\geq$ RDT \hfill (radiation lower bound) 						\item Rate of Spread $\geq$ ROST \hfill (rate of spread lower bound)\\
 				\end{enumerate}
 				If these conditions are satisfied, we need to compute a sending message probability, in other words, a fire spread probability. In order to include the time effect, a decreasing probability function on $t$ can be applied, including the $Firestart$ parameter in its definition as: \\ \\ $\mathbb{P}($Send a messages in $(t>s)$/Cell burnt in $s)= e^{-\frac{t-s-1}{C}} $ where $C$ is a constant that we can modify. \\ \\
 				After computing this probability, we obtain a random number from an U($0$,$1$) distribution and we check if a message is sent. If a message is sent, next step is to evaluate which adjacent cells are going to receive that message, analyzing the wind direction. Based on the angle between cells' gravity centers, each cell has an $Adjacents$ dictionary where cells are classified in any of the eight cardinal points. These cardinal points are associated to different ranges (see \textbf{\ref{Adjacents}}): $N \in [45^o,135^o]$, $ S \in [225^o,315^o]$, $ E \in [0^o,45^o] \cup [315^o,360^o] $ \& $ W \in [135^o,225^o]$.

\includegraphics[scale=0.95]{Adjacents.png}
\begin{center}
Figure 4: Adjacent cells and angles example. Cell 5 sends a message to cell 3 and then cell 3 sends message to cell 2, based on wind direction. \\  
\end{center}  


 	\paragraph{•}		 			
 			\item $got\_Burnt(Period,Weather,NMsg)$:\\
 			Similar to the previous function, a cell that got a message (or more) from an adjacent cell will get burnt if some weather conditions are satisfied and also, depending on the number of received messages. \\ \\
 			 If more than $N_{cell}$ messages are received (a parameter, depending on cell characteristics, type or other elements), fuel type (FType parameter) of the cell is ``burnable" and particular weather conditions are satisfied, a cell gets burnt with a very high probability (between 90 to 100\%), otherwise, if a cell is not a ``burnable type", it still has a chance of getting burnt, based on some probability function. \\
 			
 			The idea behind this scheme is to add stochasticity to the simulation. If we not include these probabilities, every time a cell gets a message, it will have the same behavior/result no matter the number of messages received or fuel type, something that in practice is not so realistic.  
 			
\end{itemize} 		
\end{enumerate}

	
	
	\item \textbf{Forest}\\
	Defines the main parameters of the instance.\\ $Obj$ = $Forest(ID,Location,Coord,NCells,Area,Vol,Age,Perimeter,FTypes)$
\begin{enumerate}
 		\item \textbf{Parameters}\\
 		\textbf{Inmutables} 
 			\begin{itemize}

 				\item $Age$: Age of the forest. \hfill (int) 
 				\item $Location$: Location of the forest. \hfill (string)
 				\item $Coord$: Coordinates of forest's gravity center. \hfill (list[float])
 				\item $Perimeter$: Forest perimeter [m]. \hfill (float)
 				\item $FTypes$: Types of fuels. \hfill (dictionary)
 				\item $CellsDistance$: Distance matrix for cells (gravity centers). \hfill (dictionary)
 			\end{itemize}
 			
 			\textbf{Mutables}
 			\begin{itemize}
 					
 				\item $AvailCells$: List of available (non-burnt) cells. \hfill (list[int]) 
 				\item $BurntCells$: List of burnt cells. \hfill (list[int]) 
 				\item $HarvestCells$: List of harvested cells. \hfill (list[int])  \\
 			\end{itemize}
 		\item \textbf{Functions \& Methods}
 			\begin{itemize}
 				\item $set\_AvailCells(Period,AvailCells\_set)$: \\ AvailCells list takes the value from the actual AvailCells set (global set). \hfill (returns list[int]) 
 				\item $set\_BurntCells(Period,BurntCells\_set)$: \\ BurntCells list takes the value from the actual BurntCells set (global set). \hfill (returns list[int]) 
 				\item $print\_info()$: \\Prints forest information (ID, Location, etc.). \hfill (void method) 
 			\end{itemize}
 			
 	\end{enumerate}

	
	
	\item \textbf{Lightning}\\
Fire ignition class, determines the week when fire starts, based on a (non) homogeneous Poisson strike.	

$Obj$ = $Lightning(Period)$.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Parameters}\\
	\textbf{Inmutables}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item $\lambda_0$: Initial fire strike rate [Fires/Fire Season], where Fire Season's length is 12 weeks (3 months). \hfill (float) 
		\end{itemize}
	\textbf{Mutables}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item $\alpha$: Probability factor. \hfill (float) \\
		\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Functions \& Methods}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item $Lambda\_Homogeneous(Period)$: \\ Returns true if a fire starts in a particular week of the fire season using a Poisson distribution. \hfill (returns boolean)
			\item $Lambda\_Non\_Homogeneous(Period)$: \\ Returns true if a fire starts in a particular week of the fire season, but using a non-homogeneous Poisson distribution. \hfill (returns boolean) \\ 
			
			\textbf{Example} \\
			Let's say that the ignition probability during the fire season is based on a poisson strike $\lambda(t)$ [fires/fire season]. Index $t$ represents the week when fire ignites. Since we know that a fire has to ignite in order to start the simulation, $\lambda(t)$ can be an increasing function on $t$, having a higher probability of ignition in a week if no ignitions happened before. \\
			
			Let: \\
			$\lambda(t) = \lambda_0(1+\alpha(t-1))$ \hspace{0.5 cm} $(t\geq 1)$ \\ Then $\Lambda_{(t_{a},t_{b})} = \int_{t_a}^{t_b} \lambda_{t}d_{t} = \frac{\lambda_{0}}{2}(2(t_{b}-t_{a})+\alpha(t_{b}^{2}-t_{a}^{2}-2))$  \\
			
			Since we are dealing with a non-homogeneous Poisson process, we have: \\
			$N(t):=$ Poisson counting process, number of fires.\\
			Probability of having $k$ ignitions until period $t$: $\mathbb{P}(N(t)=k) = \frac{(e^{-\Lambda_{(0,t)} t}) \Lambda_{(0,t)}^k}{k!} $ \\
			
			Thus, probability of not having an ignition in week 1 is: \\ $\mathbb{P}(N(1)=0) = \frac{(e^{-\Lambda_{(0,1)}}) \Lambda_{(0,1)}^0}{0!} = e^{-\Lambda_{(0,t)}}$ \\
			
			Finally, probability of not having an ignition in week $t$, if no ignition happened in previous weeks: \\
			$\mathbb{P}(N(t)=0/N(t-1)=0) = \mathbb{P}(N(t)-N(t-1)=0) = e^{-\Lambda_{(t-1,t)}}$ \\
			
			Thanks to this expression, ignition probabilities are related to the previous events, instead of the classic ``loss of memory'' property, present in a homogeneous process. \\
			
			Another classic approach is to model the $\lambda(t)$ function with a peak in the middle of the time horizon and then decrease it until the end of the season:\\	
		$$
		\lambda(t) = 
		\begin{cases}
				\lambda_0 t, & \text{if}\ t< $Middle of fire season$ \\
      			\lambda_0 (\rho_t-t), &  \text{otherwise}
		\end{cases}		
		$$

	
		Where $\rho_t$ is a parameter that can change through time (or not), allowing us to have different probabilities distributions: symmetric, higher probability in extreme periods, etc. 
			
			
			
		\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

	
	\item \textbf{ReadData}\\
		Reads input files needed for performing the simulations. It interacts with The Canadian Forest Fire Behavior Prediction (FBP) System functions and formulas that are included inside SimName for computing the fire spread dynamics. In addition, it defines the structures applied for manipulating all the input data.		
	
	\item \textbf{ReadDataPrometheus}\\
		This class reads all the input files that can be used in Prometheus simulator and translates them for SimName. Thus, users that have already their files in this format can easily use them for simulating fires with SimName.
	
	\item \textbf{SpottingFBP}\\
		Defines the spotting physical model and computes the probabilities of sending spotting messages within the forest. 	
	
	\item \textbf{WeatherFBP} \\
	Weather objects where all parameters like Wind Speed, Wind Direction, Dew Point, Temperature, etc., are computed and updated from an initial state. 

$Obj$ = $Weather(Initial$\_$Weather)$, where $Initial\_Weather$ is a dictionary.

	\begin{enumerate}
 		\item \textbf{Parameters}\\
 		\textbf{Mutables}
 			\begin{itemize}
 				\item $WindSpeed$: Wind speed in [km/hr]. \hfill (float)
 				\item $WindDirection$: Wind Direction in grades (angles). \hfill (float) 
 				\item $Temperature$: Temperature in [$C^{o}$]. \hfill (float)
 				\item $DPoint$: Dew point in [$C^{o}$]. \hfill (float)
 				\item $Rain$: Precipitation in [mm]. \hfill (float)
 				\item $Radiation$: Radiation in [J/kg]. \hfill (float)   \\
 			\end{itemize}

	\textbf{Example} \\
	$Initial\_Weather = \lbrace ``Wind\_Speed": 24$, $ ``Wind\_Direction": 56$, $ ``Temperature": 23$, $ ``Dew\_Point": 8$, $ ``Precipitation": 0.0$ , $ ``Radiation": 12 \rbrace$ \\ 			
 			
 		\item \textbf{Functions \& Methods}
 			\begin{itemize}
 				\item $set\_Weather(WeatherSet)$:\\ 
 				Sets a new weather from a dictionary. \hfill (void method) 
 				\item $update\_Weather(Period)$: \\
 				Updates the weather based on its current state and forecasts. \hfill (void method)
 				\item $get\_Weather()$: \\
 				Returns the actual weather. \hfill (returns dictionary) 
 				\item $print\_info()$: \\
 				Prints weather information (wind, t	emperature, etc.). \hfill (void method) 
 			\end{itemize}
 	\end{enumerate}
 	
Depending on how we are going to deal with weather updating, the class allows the use of the following approaches:
 
\begin{itemize}	
\item \textbf{Random Weather} \\
Each component of the weather is affected by a \% depending on a random variable generated from an uniform distribution U($a$,$b$), where $a$ and $b$ are different for each weather component (e.g. $a_{WindSpeed} \neq a_{Temperature}$). Let's call them 
$\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta, \eta$ and $\theta;$ associated to wind speed, wind direction, temperature, dew point, rain and radiation, respectively. 

Next, every component of the weather is updated based on current values and the random variables (note that these random values can be negative if $a < 0$):
\begin{itemize}
	\item $Wind\_Speed_t = Wind\_Speed_{t-1}(1+\alpha)$
	\item $Wind\_Direction_t = Wind\_Direction_{t-1}(1+\beta)$
	\item $Temperature = Temperature_{t-1}(1+\gamma)$
	\item $Dew\_point_t = Dew\_Point_{t-1}(1+\delta)$  
	\item $Rain_t = Rain_{t-1}(1+\eta)$
	\item $Radiation_t = Radiation_{t-1}(1+\theta)$
\end{itemize}

In a second step, a probability of raining $p_r$ is initialized (by some method) and also, a conditional rain probability $q_r$ is computed like $\mathbb{P}$(Rain in period $t$/Rain in period $t-1$). Since we are focused in the fire season, the main idea is to keep in mind that it is not so likely to have rain in consecutive periods. Thus, $p_r \geq q_r$. \\

\end{itemize}
	
	\item \textbf{Plot}\\
		Generates the plots associated with the fire evolution. It translates the forest data into a grid and assigns colors to each cell based on their fuel types. Then, if called, it plots every step during the simulation process indicating which cells are burning, already burnt, harvested, available, and which ones are sending messages to others depending on the weather conditions.
			
	\item \textbf{Output}\\	
		Outputs class: contains the logic for generating all the possible information from the simulator such as final forest grids in text format representing the fire scar, replications translated to scenarios.dat data files and excel files ready to perform some statistical analysis.
	
	\item \textbf{Parallel}\\
	Parallel implementation uses MPI (Message Passing Interface) in Python, ready to be used in HPC (High Performance Computers) and in a distributed computing approach in any desktop computer with multiple cores. We exploit parallel programming when: creating objects (initializing the experimental instance), processing them (send and receive message loop) and when writing final results.
		
	\item \textbf{Heuristic}\\
		Contains all the harvesting heuristics that can be applied during the simulation. It also adds the possibility of using a custom harvesting plan for evaluation purposes, allowing the decision maker to test the performance of the proposed plan for a particular year or the entire planning horizon.
	
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Global Parameters}
	Some global parameters are needed in order to develop the simulation, including sets, lists and dictionaries that are updated on every step.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $AvailCells\_set$: Set that contains all the available cells of the forest. \hfill (set)
		\item $BurntCells\_set$: Set of all the burnt cells of the forest. \hfill (set)
		\item $HarvestedCells\_set$: Set with all the harvested cells of the forest. \hfill (set)
		\item $GlobalPeriod$: Current stage (week) of the simulation. \hfill (int)
		\item $FirePeriods[Seasons]$: Current fire period of the season. \hfill (int)
		\item $Seasons$: Current fire season in simulation. \hfill (int)
		\item $Max\_Seasons$: Number of fire seasons to simulate.\hfill (int)

		\item $Global\_Message\_List$: Message list, with all the messages senders and receivers (cells) per period. \hfill (list[int])
	\end{itemize}

\section{Future/Current Work}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Gather and test more real life instances with different weather conditions and compare them with existing simulator outputs in order to validate SimName's performance. A series of experiments must be done in order to determine the best value of relevant parameters (like thresholds).
	\item Fire evolution comparison with Prometheus. The current comparisons take into account the last state of the forest (final fire scar), while progressive scars (fire evolution) are not being compared. 	Thus, we would be able to determine if both models present similar fire spread evolutions.
	\item Spotting model: implement a formal spotting model. 
	\item Optimization of SimName functions. A general optimization of the most relevant functions and methods has been performed. Secondary functions will be optimized, taking advantage of parallel/concurrent computing approaches.
	\item An optimized version for HPC (high performance computers) will be finished. It takes advantage of the cluster structure and implements a series of rules for queuing the different jobs among clusters/nodes.
	\item Full integration of the simulator with the GIS module for the 3D-mesh generation. Current beta implementation needs a series of software packages to be installed on the local machine in order to generate the visualization app and three dimensional forest video. Next version will run on an external server, just needing an internet connection.
	\item Formal article (paper): start writting it based on the documents and results we have.
